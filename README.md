Information security is one of today's most difficult issues. One of the  factors contributing to invaders' success is the fact that the majority of  the data they obtain from a system is in a format they can read and  understand. Intruders may divulge the information to third parties, alter it  to falsely represent a person or group, or use it to carry out an attack.  Various techniques have been used to protect the transfer of sensitive  data via the internet.  
 This project suggests a system that combines cryptography with  image steganography. User chooses the file and enters a key and a  picture. Using this key, the user data (file data) is encrypted, and after  that, the cypher text is encoded in the image. There are two layers of  security: one that hides information using steganography, and the other  that encrypts it to keep it safe.
